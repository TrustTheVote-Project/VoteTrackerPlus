## The Pitch

VoteTracker+ is an open software vote tracking system that increases the security, accuracy, and trustworthiness of a paper ballot election by cryptographically and anonymously tracking the votes associated with paper ballots.

VoteTracker+ provides three core capabilities:

1. Directly supplies a cryptographically anonymized ballot check back to the voter, allowing the voter to validate that their specific ballot has been interpreted, recorded, and tallied as intended - a.k.a. End-to-End Verification ([E2EV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_auditable_voting_systems))

2. Cryptographically records and seals the entire history of the election as it occurs in near real time

3. Allows the public to inspect and validate the official Cast Vote Records and tally as well as potentially, via optional future extensions, the aggregate voter ID rolls across the entire electorate

See [E2EV.md](E2EV.md) for more details regarding how VTP supplies E2EV and how the live [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) based demo demonstrates that.
