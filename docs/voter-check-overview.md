# More Details on the VoteTracker+ Voter Anonymized Ballot Check

## 1) Terminology

For definitions and technical terms, please refer to the [NIST Glossary](https://pages.nist.gov/ElectionGlossary/)

## 2) Background

A foundational aspect of VoteTracker+ is the basic capability to offer to the voter a personalized but anonymized ballot check that contains no connection to their identity nor to their ballot.  To achieve this VoteTracker+ relies on both a specific UX (User eXperience, a.k.a. voter centric workflow) and technology.

From a UX point of view an overview of the voter experience is as follows:

1. After the voter marks their ballot, they submit it to the ballot scanner (not part of VoteTracker+)
1. The ballot scanner scans thier ballot and presents the voter with a human readable form of the [Cast Vote Records](https://pages.nist.gov/ElectionGlossary/#cast-vote-record).  The voter can accept or reject the ballot scanning.
1. After accepting the CVR, the scanner privately displays to the voter in a manner not observable by a third party their specific row offset on their specific voter check
1. The ballot scanner prints thier ballot check on a 8.5x11 sheet of paper
1. Prior to leaving the voting center, the voter can place their check on a separate scanner that will validate that the CVR's referenced on the check are now in fact contained in the official voter center's local VoteTracker+ repositories.  These repositories are in fact Merkle Trees that contain additional security details in addition to their history preserving aspects.

The first key step is step 3.  Even though the voter can share their check if they so choose, doing so does not reveal how they voted or what their identity is since the sheet contains 100 additional ballots worth of CVRs.

The second key aspect is the Merkle Tree aspect of the VoteTracker+ repositories.  By confirming to the voter that the CVR's on their ballot check are now part of the official Merkle Trees of the local voting center, the voter has a valid check for 100 CVRs including their own.

The rest of this document describes the technology in play regarding the voter check and the workflow described above.

## 3) Details of the Timeline for the Generation of the Voter's Anonymized Ballot Check

The following timeline assumes the following design choices.  These design decisions may change upon further research and discovery.

1. The ballot scanner is effectively a separate and individual OS/container/lambda function with its own file system, processes, and security model.  This is not a design requirement but an assumption.
1. Each voting center basically contains a Git service that hosts a voting center local git repository.  Various devices in the voting center will pull and push into this Git service.  For reference this repo is referred to as the local remote repository.
1. The local remote Git repo primarily operates on the master branch.
1. The ballot scanners have the ability to print but only in one color that does not match either the lead pencil or the ink pens provided by the election officials to the voters to fill out the ballot.
1. The JSON payload that contains the CVRs as well as additional VoteTracker+ fields is stored as the Git commit comment and not as a separate file on a file system.
1. The various voting center devices participating in VoteTracker+ are hardwired together.  There are specific security procedures in play on the physical LAN.

### 3.1) On the ballot scanner after the voter has blessed the CVR of their ballot:

1. The ballot scanner will fetch from the local remote Git repo.
1. A random master branch commit is selected back in history from the previous 100 commits, a different such commit for each contest.  Since there are never any merge conflicts, the location of the branch point on master is moot.
1. A randomly generated number but one that is also a function of the election CA/ICA chain is signed/digested by the voting center's private key and printed on the paper ballot.  This number is also associated with the digital scan of the ballot managed by the physical scanner.
1. The contests on the current voter's CVR are selected in random order and committed in separate branches without time information (or with time information set to a specific date/time).  Blank contests are recorded as such - as a blank.
1. The JSON payload of the Git commit contains several additional fields, one being the value of the parent commit (on master) being encoded/digested by the private pem keys of the voting center as signed by RA chain for the election.  It is a security model TBD if there is also a voting center function that signs with the CA/ICA of the election as well.  See the VoteTracker+ security model for more details.
1. The first contest on the ballot also has a JSON field that contains the same generated paper ballot ID number printed on the ballot.
1. The actual Git commit digests __are__ the digests that the voter will eventually receive.
1. The (new) voter's commits are pushed to the local remote Git repo as new branches again in random order, incrementing by N contests the number of unmerged branches on the local remote.
1. 99 random contest sets are selected (starting from the last fetch) and the 100 row ballot check is constructed for the voter.  The voter's specific digests for their ballot/CVR are randomly placed on some row.  That row number is displayed securely and privately to the voter while the voter check sheet is being printed.  Once displayed to the voter and cleared, there is no longer any record of the which row belongs to the voters stored anywhere in software.  The public can validate this piece by reviewing the source code contained in the Merkle Tree and the operational provenance of the scanning device.
1.  It is a TBD how the local contest branches are handled in the local repo - it is a security model TBD.  It may be the case that they are deleted and the local Git is GC'ed and the reflog cleared.  Or it may be the case that some of this data persists for forensics in case of a compromise at the voting center.

### 3.2) On the local remote Git repo

1. The local remote Git repo receives the N context pushed from a ballot scanning device.
1. For each contest, whenever there are more than 100 branches, a random branch is selected, merged to master (no rebase, no squash), and deleted.  This process is repeated for the other contests.  It is a security TBD what the best random function is and if the life span of a branch should be limited or not.

### 3.3) Pushing live election results upstream

If the voting center is online and the operational security measures are in place, then the voting center's central repository can be pushed to the upstream repository which is nominally a fork of the state root repository.  Once the voting center's fork as been updated, a Git Pull Request (a PR) is created to track the merge process.  An out-of-band human 2FA workflow is followed to validate the commit and once validated, the fork is fast-forwarded merged into the root repo and the git submodule reference is updated in the root repository.

If the voting center is not online, the push will happen whenever it can happen.  This could either be online or by some other air gapped means.

### 3.4) Updating the publicly available VoteTracker+ reposirories

As the read-write repositories are updated, the publicly available readonly forks/clones are updated as frequently as desired.  Again this update can be done via online or air-gapped methods (a security TBD).  The general public can download the readonly clones at will as the read-write system is cloaked as much as possible, if not entirely separate, from the internet and possible other shared infrastructure systems.

### 3.5) Some VoteTracker+ hardware notes

As of this writing it is still a TBD as to the specific hardware topology that a VoteTracker+ prototype and/or deployed system will be running.  However, what follows are a few assumptions and guiding principles:

- there will not be any WiFi component in a VoteTracker+ deployment
- when any VoteTracker+ device boots, the presiding election official must sign in and verify their pgp key that is used and required for every commit.
- the security model of the LAN on which VoteTracker+ runs is a TBD and a separate security domain from that of the data at rest and data in movement aspects of VoteTracker+ data
- the operational provenance of the software that runs on each device is a TBD and a separate security domain from that of the data at rest and data in movement aspects of VoteTracker+ data
