Will leverage this current git repository (VoteTrackerPlus) and the
associated ElectionData repo(s) to nominally create in
/opt/VoteTrackerPlus (the default) a demo election with 4 mock ballot
scanner apps and one tabulation server app. The initial demo idea is
to have three scanners scanning random ballots while one scanner is
used interactively.

All five apps run in separate git workspaces that are clones of the
same ElectionData repo(s). The (4) mock scanner app clones are located
in one folder, the one tabulation server is located in another, and
the FastAPI clients are located in a third. The FastAPI clients are
separated by a GUID based subdirectory similar to the native Git
storage idiom.

If the --guid_client_store option is set, instead of setting up the
demo this script will create a new GUID based FASTapi clone and return
the GUID.
